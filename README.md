NSF Proposal in LaTeX
====

This project is your glass of water to the hell that is MS Word. Scientific proposals are daunting and compiling all of the required material is tedious. This LaTeX template constructs a proposal according to the most recent [guidelines][1] of the [National Science Foundation][2]. The template uses the reference styling of the American Meteorological Society. You can easily substitute your own style file. 

The end product is a visually consistent and beautiful proposal document. I cannot help you with the science, but I can help you present something that does not look like garbage.
